## Super Mouse Lock
#### 1. Function description
This tool is used for `Windows` systems above `Windows 7`. It is written in `Python` and utilizes libraries such as `Pynput`, `Keyboard`, and `PyAutoGui`. Thank you to the author of these libraries! This project
Silent mouse lock can be performed, which takes up almost no resources and can be hung in the background for a long time. After 60 seconds without moving the mouse or keyboard, the mouse will be automatically locked in the center of the field of view and the keyboard will be locked. After 180 seconds, a simulated blue screen will be launched, and the mouse will be locked
Click the middle mouse button to unlock the status, right-click on the blue screen status menu to unlock. Add a tray icon, right-click to modify settings (including locking mouse and keyboard time, enabling simulated blue screen time, using simulated styles such as blue screen, FBI, update, restart, etc.)
